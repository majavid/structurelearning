## Introduction
![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/majavid/structurelearning/master/assets/img/images.gif)
LWF Chain graphs were introduced by Lauritzen, Wermuth and Frydenberg as a generalization of graphical models based on undirected graphs and DAGs. From the causality point of view, in an LWF CG: Directed edges represent direct causal effects. Undirected edges represents causal effects due to _interference_, which occurs when an individualâ€™s outcome is influenced by their social interaction with other population members, e.g., in situations that involve contagious agents, educational programs, or social networks. The construction of chain graph models is a challenging task that would be greatly facilitated by automation. 
_Markov blanket_ discovery has an important role in structure learning of Bayesian network. It is surprising, however, how little attention it has attracted in the context of learning LWF chain graphs. In this work,  we provide a graphical characterization of Markov blankets in chain graphs. The characterization is different from the well-known one for Bayesian networks and generalizes it. We provide a novel _scalable_ and _sound_ algorithm for Markov blanket discovery in LWF chain graphs. We also provide a sound and scalable constraint-based framework for learning the structure of LWF CGs from faithful causally sufficient data. With the use of our algorithm, the problem of structure learning is reduced to finding an efficient algorithm for Markov blanket discovery in LWF chain graphs. This greatly simplifies the structure-learning task and makes a wide range of inference/learning problems computationally tractable because our approach exploit locality.
